			<p class="text-justify">Soil, wood, oil. minerals, petroleum, water are considered natural resources because they occur in their natural form and are not made by human beings.Humans can only modify natural resources. The energy that makes natural resources comes from geochemical, geophysical and solar energy.</p>

			<p class="text-justify">The exploitation of nature and natural resources can be dated back to the advent of humankind and the very start of civilization. Earlier people used to cut trees for fuel, for building materials for boats and for shelter. There are two kinds of natural resources- renewable and nonrenewable.</p>

			<p class="text-justify">Wood which is one of the main natural resources has the advantage of being renewable. Fish, animals and forests can renew themselves if they are not over-harvested. Forests can be replanted and, in time, the wood that was used can be replaced. The  trees that are a renewable resource all these are non renewable. The reserves are finite and at some point in the future they will be depleted. We need to first conserve what we have left and to do that the call of the day is to use these natural resources sparingly and responsibly. We must resort to the use of alternative forms of energy which will lessen the burden on our natural resources. There are various forms of alternative energy available. Light from the Sun also called as Solar Energy can be converted into electricity. This solar energy could be used to cook food. Wind power could also be used to generate electricity.</p>

			<p class="text-justify" style="text-indent: 25px;">A renewable resource is one which can be used again and again. For example, soil, sunlight and water are renewable resources. However, in some circumstances, even water is not renewable easily. Wood is a renewable resource, but it takes time to renew and in some places people use the land for something else. Soil, if it blows away, is not easy to renew.

			<p class="text-justify" style="text-indent: 25px;">A non-renewable resource is a resource that does not grow and come back, or a resource that would take a very long time to come back. For example, coal is a non-renewable resource. When we use coal, there is less coal afterward. The non-renewable resource can be used directly (for example, burning oil to cook), or we can find a renewable resource to use (for example, using wind energy to make electricity to cook).</p>
